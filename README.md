# DeepFake Detection App

A simple Streamlit app to detect DeepFake images using classical machine learning techniques (XGBoost + Feature Selection).

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit app interface
- `src/`: Python scripts for feature extraction and model training
- `models/`: Trained models (`xgboost_model.pkl` and `feature_selector.pkl`)

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

2. Run the app:

## Notes

- This project uses handcrafted features and classical ML techniques.
